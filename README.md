# aws
this is my aws repostitory and the steps that i follow in learning this will be updated here

Points to know before learning anything follow these three steps

1, Why that technology came 
2. what is the problem it solved
3. How it's been used and implemented in the real world.

Now I will tell you my understanding on this AWS 
-- All these cloud service providers are helping organizations by providing their servers, storage capacity and the networking.

-- The very imporatnt thing is that no matter which cloud it is the fundamental thing about these are simple
1. Storage
2. compute
3. Networkin

-- These 3 are the major imporatant and these are provided by these cloud providers like aws

Now the question is should we depend on these providers really
-- The simple answer is No...
-- Every organization can have their own servers and can use them but here comes the problems what if the organization can't afford it.

Yed so many startups will not have money for setting up their own data centers so they will choose these cloud providers because they have an amazing policy is that "pay as you use"
This policy makes easier for the small startups to use them when they need and they can make cost savings.

I hope you got an idea what exactly happening behind these cloud service providers.

So now let's see what is AWS and the popular services it provides
